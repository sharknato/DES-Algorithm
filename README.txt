DES Program v1.0
Author: Nate Kelley

This is a program written as an assignment to perform a simple DES operation to encrypt input 
strings of 16 characters with a key of 16 characters. It was interesting learning more about Python
strings and converting between numbers and binary strings.

In the future, I would like to create the required tables in a separate file for ease of reading. 
Additionally I am interested in reversing the algorithm to create a decryption program
